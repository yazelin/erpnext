"<h3>About Product Bundle</h3>

<p>Aggregate group of <b>Items</b> into another <b>Item</b>. This is useful if you are bundling a certain <b>Items</b> into a package and you maintain stock of the packed <b>Items</b> and not the aggregate <b>Item</b>.</p>
<p>The package <b>Item</b> will have <code>Is Stock Item</code> as <b>No</b> and <code>Is Sales Item</code> as <b>Yes</b>.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>If you are selling Laptops and Backpacks separately and have a special price if the customer buys both, then the Laptop + Backpack will be a new Product Bundle Item.</p>","<h3>關於產品捆綁包</h3>

<p>將一組<b>貨品</b>彙總到另一個<b>貨品</b>中。如果您要將某個<b>專案</b>捆綁到一個包中，而您只保留打包<b>專案</b>的庫存，而不保留彙總<b>專案</b>的庫存，這將非常有用。</p>
<p>打包<b>專案</b>的<code>Is Stock</code> <b>Item</b> <code>（庫存專案）</code>為<b>No</b>，<code>Is Sales Item</code> <code>（銷售專案</code>）為<b>Yes</b>。</p>
